    "title": "Extremely slow support and unclear process left time-sensitive parcels stuck",
    "text": "Based on my personal experience, Buyandship’s customer support response time is extremely slow, which became a serious problem for a time-sensitive shipment.\n\nSeveral parcels were automatically forwarded from the US warehouse to the Hong Kong warehouse, and only after this auto-forwarding did I learn that the items (perfumes) were considered regulated / prohibited for onward shipment. There was no clear warning or system block before forwarding, which resulted in the parcels being stuck and placed the burden on the customer to resolve an issue created by the process itself.\n\nI contacted customer service to clarify what options were actually available, including whether self-collection was possible and what the exact requirements were. Despite these being straightforward questions, responses consistently took many hours to over a full day, even when marked as active.\n\nReplies were often generic or only partially answered, leading to repeated back-and-forth over multiple days. As of writing, I still do not have clear, complete answers, and the situation remains unresolved.\n\nWhat makes this especially frustrating is that the in-app messaging states a typical response time of around one hour, which does not reflect reality. There were also instances where customer service agents appeared online, yet messages remained unanswered for long periods. There is also no clear escalation path for urgent cases.\n\nWhile perfumes are listed as regulated items, the lack of clear, proactive communication before auto-forwarding, combined with extremely slow follow-up support, caused unnecessary delay, uncertainty, and disruption.\n\nFor a logistics service handling customers’ parcels and money, this level of response time and lack of clarity is unacceptable. Faster responses, clearer upfront warnings, and proper handling of time-sensitive issues are urgently needed.\n",

We are truly sorry that your experience did not go as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nSince all of our parcels travel by air, perfumes are classified as flammable and are strictly prohibited on flights. That is why they are always included on our prohibited items list (you may view the full list here: https://www.buyandship.com.sg/restrictions/#all).\n\nAt the moment, our system is unable to automatically detect prohibited items when members submit product links. However, it’s something we’re actively looking into adding in future.\n\nOur customer support team operates from Monday through Saturday, and we are doing our best to respond to all inquiries as quickly as possible. Regarding your case, our customer service representative will reach out to you shortly to discuss the pick-up arrangements.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if there is anything else we can assist you with.

We truly appreciate it and are sorry to hear that your recent experience didn’t meet your expectations.\n\nFor clarity on the fees, all our charges are listed transparently on our website (https://www.buyandship.com.sg/features/proxy-shopping/) under the “How Does Buy&Ship Charge?” section. The S$20 you were charged is solely the processing fee that the last-mile courier is required to collect. Separately, the GST was applied in accordance with Singapore government regulations, which mandate GST on shipments with a declared value of S$400 or above. We always recommend checking the GST details on our website (https://www.buyandship.com.sg/taxation/) before shipping. \n\nRegarding the delivery process, all parcels are first routed to our Hong Kong warehouse for consolidation. Once consolidation is complete, we normally hand the shipment over to our last-mile delivery partner within 1–2 business days.\n\nOur customer support team is always here to help. If you have any further questions or need anything clarified, please don’t hesitate to reach out via live chat on our website — we’d be happy to help and make your next experience a much smoother one.",

    "text": "I've a shipment that has been marked as packed for a week with no other updates. The other 2 packages I consolidated at the same time so far via Jump Point have already been received by me. Asked CS what's the status of my shipment and they keep asking me for product purchase screenshots, product tracking numbers, but I don't see how they need it when all my 10 parcels are already packed and has a tracking number generated and has cleared customs already. Unless you're telling me all my 10 parcels are still separately landing in my country one by one before they tag the shipment tracking number to it, which makes no bloody sense. I'm going in circles puking blood talking to CS and all I want to know is where is my shipment, not my individual parcels (those are already inside the damn shipment). Why do you need all 10 product details and tracking numbers to locate my packed shipment? Unless it's not been packed at all? I'm going to treat the shipment as missing if it still has no updates after another week. \n\nUpdate: They indeed lost 4 of my parcels. They offered to refund me some amount, but there's no reason given as to why it got lost. Will need to check if they will really refund me or not in 30 days or I have to keep chasing. \nI'm not sure if the fault is with Ninjavan now or BnS. Not sure if UPS is worth trying either based on the terrible sg reviews. So far Janio has never lost my parcels but they have changed delivery providers.",

At first I suspected the sellers, but looking at their feedback history and typical packing, this does not appear to be how they ship. The damage/alterations likely happened during Buyandship’s warehousing or repacking.\n\nSeparately, five more items that arrived at the Hong Kong warehouse on Jul 9 have shown “Under Customs Clearance” ever since. It’s now almost two months with no meaningful update, no case number, no check-in logs, no customs entry number, and no reason given—only generic messages.\n\nI can accept that customs can be slow. What I cannot accept is no transparency and no accountability. Between the damaged “new in box” items and the five parcels effectively missing in HK, this has been a very poor experience. I would not use this service again.",

    "text": "I received an email saying one of my shipments has problem but did not indicate which shipment and what was the problem. Only after chatting with the CSO Jackie did he/she mentioned that one of the shipments contained scissors and cannot be shipped because it is a prohibited item.\n\nArgued with Jackie that no where in the website did it mention that scissors are prohibited items and I have previously shipped scissors using Buy&Ship without problems so why now. Jackie insisted that scissors are sharp items and may be detained by customs so they don't recommend shipping. Notice the word Jackie used was recommend and not because it is by law.\n\nI questioned Jackie in that case why is it that Buy&Ship can ship the scissors from Japan where I bought, to Hong Kong warehouse then. He/she could not answer me and finally gave in and processed my shipments but told me not to ship such items again.\n\nThis is not my first time having bad experience with Buy&Ship but is probably my last time as I decided not to use their service anymore; and so decided to write a review for people to refer especially for first timers who are thinking of using their service.\n\nI include the full chat log below. Judge for yourself if this company is worth your money.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nMe: hi, i received an email saying my shipment has problem but did not specify which item and what problem\n\nBuy&Ship: Your order (91973354) contains prohibited item (scrissors)and can't be shipped. You may:\n﻿1. Discard the prohibited item and we will ship the rest\n﻿2. Arrange courier to our warehouse to pick up whole order and ship to you. (Please provide the shipping label & invoice at least 1 working day before the date of pick up)\n﻿3. Ship the whole order to a HK address. (Please provide recipient name, phone number and address)\nKindly note that there will be no refund of shipping fee as the fee is counted from overseas warehouse, also the parcel has violated our shipping restriction. The shipment can be stored in the Hong Kong warehouse for the next 30 days and will be auto-abandonment without further notice if no handling instruction is received within the storage period.\n\nPlease let us know your decision, thank you\n\nMe: why is scissors prohibited? under which category? i ever shipped scissors before. why now it is prohibited?\n\nBuy&Ship: The scissors are considered as sharp items and may be detained by the customs.\nTherefore, we don't recommend to ship with it.\nThank you\n\nMe: your country dont sell scissors?\nthen why you can ship from japan to hong kong?\n\nBuy&Ship: We have noted your concern and will inform the warehouse to ship out in one time exception.\nPlease do not ship this kind of items to the warehouse again.\nThank you\n\nMe: in that case you should also indicate scissors as prohibited items. i only see knives and blades mentioned\n\nBuy&Ship: We will forward your comment to the related department and review the website info.\nThank you\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReply to Buy&Ship 28 August 2025\nSo one supplier cannot ship but another supplier can. What a joke! Since when suppliers can make up their own law to determine what can be shipped and cannot be shipped.\n\nI checked in Singapore customs website and no where is it stated that scissors are prohibited items. Either your supplier is smoking you or you are smoking me. The more excuses you come up with, the more it looks bad on you. Shouldn’t you do your due diligence to verify each country’s custom law instead of relying on your suppliers and left users hanging to dry when shit happens!",

    "text": "my paddle is completely destroyed and not way to repair. It was crashed from side and both side of paddle badly indented. in order to have damage like this, it need very heavy impact or heavy item from top while the paddle side is facing top. At least 100kg of force apply on top in order to have that damaged.\n\nmy paddle is soft pack(thanks to my clever seller even mention will ship oversea and request secure and nice packing) and that is the main cause of the damaged. However, even if my seller pack with box... the paddle will not survive either, maybe just less severe. With just a box and few layers bubble wrap, it will not enough. This is because i have passed shipment with box and the  box was badly deform when reach my hand. Imagine the length of the box is around 30\" become 26\" to 27\" with 1 side crashed. Too bad, i cant share the photo here or else you wont have to imagine how it looks like. Anyway, that was lucky that everything is working because there is another hard product box that protecting all the items.\n\nLastly, do read clearly about the insurance cover that provide in Buy&Ship. If item damaged, only 30% of shipping fee can be claimed. Another words, the insurance only covering loss parcel and damaged items are not consider claimable but partial refund shipping fee. So, the insurance is pretty much useless because 80% are shipment damaged problem while loss item maybe 20% or lower.",

When purchasing from multiple stores, those other services (Starts with a Vxxx) failed to notify me if all packages had arrived for consolidation. They didn’t provide updates on parcel status unless I paid extra for upgrades, which made the process confusing and costly. Ultimately, due to this lack of transparency, I ended up paying five times more compared to when I switched to Buy&Ship!\n\nBuy&Ship completely changed my experience. Their instructions are clear and straightforward, there was no need to second guess the information. What you see is exactly what you get! They provide an itemized list of items that have arrived at their location, so you can easily track if all your purchases are ready for consolidation and shipping. Another great feature is their notification system, which informs you how many days of free storage you have left before incurring charges... they typically offer 30 days for free storage. I’ve tried their service, and it’s truly awesome!",

    "text": "My experience with Buyandship was frustrating beyond belief. A parcel I ordered from Japan arrived with severe leakage due to mishandling and repacking. Their team insisted it was the seller’s fault, but I’ve used Japanese sellers for years and never once had an issue like this — their packaging is always extremely secure. The real problem lies in Buyandship’s repackaging process, where they remove the outer protective boxes to save space. This negligence directly caused the bottles to be exposed and leak during transport.\n\nWorse still, their customer service (especially “Rain”) was unhelpful, dismissive, and evasive. They refused to take responsibility, avoided answering my direct questions, and deleted parts of our conversation. I asked for a supervisor — they ignored me. I requested a video to show how my goods were damaged — ignored again.\n\nI’ve used many international forwarding services over the years — this is by far the worst. They mishandled my goods, then tried to wash their hands of any responsibility. I will never use Buyandship again and would not recommend it to anyone who cares about their items arriving safely.",

The exchange rate provided by them when I carted out VS the amount I paid was totally off, which led to me paying way more + getting charged GST unnecessarily. When I wrote in to their customer service team, 3 people replied me and all of them gave a different answer as to how their exchange rate was derived. Extremely sketchy + zero transparency from them. I will not recommend anyone to use Buy&Ship for their proxy shopping service, and best to ship only light items as it seem that they’re just charging however they want. ",

I recall it sitting in the warehouse for a while before shipping to SG. \n\nI read reviews saying they may swap your item with a knockoff if it is a high value item. My item was less than 20 USD so I thought it would be fine.\n\nWhen we received it in SG we noticed that the item seemed off but there was not enough images online of the actual product to be sure.\n\nI only realised recently that I had gotten scammed when I saw the ACTUAL genuine item in stores in SG. (As the item seemed to now be sold here as well).\n\nGoogling more after seeing it in stores, I saw online images of the exact knockoff product that they replaced my item with and likely sold the original off to make a profit.\n\nSeeing other REAL reviews from people it seems that even if I caught it upon receiving my product, their customer service lines and service itself is completely useless! \n\nI would NOT recommend this company and stray FAR away from it.

You can also go with the slightly more expensivePalit Gaming ProorManli Polar Foxmodel and those are priced at Php 52K ~ Php 53K.Personally I don't think it's worth the risk and small savings.  You lose the local distro warranty and resale value in the 2nd hand market will be low because it is grey market / not sourced locally.Keep in mind that the RTX 5070 Ti will be phased out by end of this year ~ early next year, and will be replaced by the RTX 5070 Ti Super.

You just need to register there and you’ll be given a unique address. Use that as your shipping address. Try watchingna din sa youtube para may idea ka.",,,16,0,PH,,1745656959,1767144138448

reddit,comment,lvor2ye,nhiddles,,"I just wanted to share my recent experience with Buy&Ship. I consolidated a package on October 23rd, but it was stuck in “Checking” status for about a week. I had to contact customer service to find out what was going on. They explained there was a backlog due to a recent warehouse relocation and assured me my order would be processed within the next few days. I was fine with that—at first.Another week went by, and I had to consolidate a second package. Surprisingly, my new consolidated package was processed immediately, while my first one was still stuck in “Checking” status. I contacted customer service again, as it was unacceptable that my first package showed no progress while the second one was ready to be shipped to the Philippines. They told me that “the system” hadn’t properly synced the consolidation date for my first order, which was why it hadn’t been processed. They promised it would be handled as soon as possible.On November 1st, I finally received an update: my first package was ready to be shipped, and I was given a tracking number. However, six days have passed, and I haven’t received any tracking updates. The status remains “waiting for the shipper to hand over the package,” making me feel like they just gave me a tracking number to get me off their backs. Meanwhile, my second package is already in Manila and on its way to me.I contacted customer service again, asking for an update and requesting transparency about my shipment’s status. Unfortunately, I received no response. The customer service team has been online all day, yet no one was willing to assist me. I’ve sent multiple follow-ups, but still nothing. It’s incredibly disappointing to pay a substantial amount for their service and shipping fees, only to be ignored when I need help.I still have several packages at Buy&Ship warehouses, but I plan to reduce my use of their service moving forward.

reddit,comment,lv6thbi,orress,,"I use Buy & Ship the most kasi it's the most easiest to use. it has a very good app and a very fast, smooth and efficient process. their proxy shopping i think is the cheapest, but the best thing about them is they can consolidate shipping from all their warehouses to their main HK warehouse, compared sa iba na kung sa US ka lang bibili, eh d US warehouse lang ung ma.coconsolidate. tas i think they are the cheapest talaga in general kasi they only charge by weight alone, whereas ung iba volumetric weight ung basehan. their only con is that they only offer air cargo. when it comes to books kasi, i think its better to ship it by sea para maka-save sa weight (books always weigh heavier than you think). un nga lang sea cargo takes months to arrive, but if you schedule your orders wisely, it's easy to make it work esp mas cheaper ung sea cargo.Shipping Cart ung merong bad reviews esp nung pandemic, but I think they've recovered na. My package was late by 2 months but they were easy to contact naman for me, pero ofc maraming iba na mas worse ung na experience. they also offer proxy shopping pero clunky ung process kasi you can only do it sa app and it's slightly more expensive than Buy&Ship. pero i still use Shipping Cart especially for bulky and heavy packages because of their sea cargo option.MyShoppingBox also has both air and sea but ung web UI nila medyo luma na for me, but the experience was okay. last time i used their services was 2018 pa, but only bc i like using Shipping Cart/Buy & Ship moreKangoExpress i just have no reason to try yet kasi im still satisfied with Buy&Ship/Shipping Cart.",,,6,0,HK,,1730647188,1767144153170

They lost one of my parcel from the US and failed to get back to me. I had parcel A and parcel B which was consolidated and supposed to be shipped together from HK to SG. But after I had paid for the consolidation, they emailed me and said one of my parcel (parcel B) was missing. I emailed back and said what are they going to do about it and they asked me to wait patiently for 1 week and they will get back to me after the confirm with their HK side. But they never did get back to me. And then one day, they just sent my consolidated parcel with only parcel A from their HK warehouse without informing of anything and I assumed that they found my parcel B.Yesterday, I got the consolidated parcel which should have consisted of both parcel A and parcel B. But only received parcel A.  The declared value was also wrong as it stated both A and B values. Regardless, they still charged me for the total consolidation. This is extremely frustrating as parcel B was significantly heavier as well.I already filed a complaint and they say they will get back to me in 4 days.To be honest, I will stop using their services after I got my other parcels or refunds.",,,0,0,HK,,1730361590,1767144157116

trustpilot,review,693492f85a614c69fa6f5a0c,Jeff Yang,Extremely slow support and unclear process left time-sensitive parcels stuck,"Based on my personal experience, Buyandship’s customer support response time is extremely slow, which became a serious problem for a time-sensitive shipment.

Several parcels were automatically forwarded from the US warehouse to the Hong Kong warehouse, and only after this auto-forwarding did I learn that the items (perfumes) were considered regulated / prohibited for onward shipment. There was no clear warning or system block before forwarding, which resulted in the parcels being stuck and placed the burden on the customer to resolve an issue created by the process itself.

I contacted customer service to clarify what options were actually available, including whether self-collection was possible and what the exact requirements were. Despite these being straightforward questions, responses consistently took many hours to over a full day, even when marked as active.

Replies were often generic or only partially answered, leading to repeated back-and-forth over multiple days. As of writing, I still do not have clear, complete answers, and the situation remains unresolved.

What makes this especially frustrating is that the in-app messaging states a typical response time of around one hour, which does not reflect reality. There were also instances where customer service agents appeared online, yet messages remained unanswered for long periods. There is also no clear escalation path for urgent cases.

While perfumes are listed as regulated items, the lack of clear, proactive communication before auto-forwarding, combined with extremely slow follow-up support, caused unnecessary delay, uncertainty, and disruption.

For a logistics service handling customers’ parcels and money, this level of response time and lack of clarity is unacceptable. Faster responses, clearer upfront warnings, and proper handling of time-sensitive issues are urgently needed.

The damage/alterations likely happened during Buyandship’s warehousing or repacking.

Only after chatting with the CSO Jackie did he/she mentioned that one of the shipments contained scissors and cannot be shipped because it is a prohibited item.

Argued with Jackie that no where in the website did it mention that scissors are prohibited items and I have previously shipped scissors using Buy&Ship without problems so why now. Jackie insisted that scissors are sharp items and may be detained by customs so they don't recommend shipping. Notice the word Jackie used was recommend and not because it is by law.

I questioned Jackie in that case why is it that Buy&Ship can ship the scissors from Japan where I bought, to Hong Kong warehouse then. He/she could not answer me and finally gave in and processed my shipments but told me not to ship such items again.

This is not my first time having bad experience with Buy&Ship but is probably my last time as I decided not to use their service anymore; and so decided to write a review for people to refer especially for first timers who are thinking of using their service.

I include the full chat log below. Judge for yourself if this company is worth your money.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Me: hi, i received an email saying my shipment has problem but did not specify which item and what problem

Buy&Ship: Your order (91973354) contains prohibited item (scrissors)and can't be shipped. You may:
﻿1. Discard the prohibited item and we will ship the rest
﻿2. Arrange courier to our warehouse to pick up whole order and ship to you. (Please provide the shipping label & invoice at least 1 working day before the date of pick up)
﻿3. Ship the whole order to a HK address. (Please provide recipient name, phone number and address)
Kindly note that there will be no refund of shipping fee as the fee is counted from overseas warehouse, also the parcel has violated our shipping restriction. The shipment can be stored in the Hong Kong warehouse for the next 30 days and will be auto-abandonment without further notice if no handling instruction is received within the storage period.

Please let us know your decision, thank you

Me: why is scissors prohibited? under which category? i ever shipped scissors before. why now it is prohibited?

Buy&Ship: The scissors are considered as sharp items and may be detained by the customs.
Therefore, we don't recommend to ship with it.
Thank you

Me: your country dont sell scissors?
then why you can ship from japan to hong kong?

Buy&Ship: We have noted your concern and will inform the warehouse to ship out in one time exception.
Please do not ship this kind of items to the warehouse again.
Thank you

Me: in that case you should also indicate scissors as prohibited items. i only see knives and blades mentioned

Buy&Ship: We will forward your comment to the related department and review the website info.
Thank you

So one supplier cannot ship but another supplier can. What a joke! Since when suppliers can make up their own law to determine what can be shipped and cannot be shipped.

I checked in Singapore customs website and no where is it stated that scissors are prohibited items. Either your supplier is smoking you or you are smoking me. The more excuses you come up with, the more it looks bad on you. Shouldn’t you do your due diligence to verify each country’s custom law instead of relying on your suppliers and left users hanging to dry when shit happens!",,1,0,1,SG,BuyandShip,2025-08-25T14:57:10.000Z,1767144181190

However, even if my seller pack with box... the paddle will not survive either, maybe just less severe. With just a box and few layers bubble wrap, it will not enough. This is because i have passed shipment with box and the  box was badly deform when reach my hand. Imagine the length of the box is around 30"" become 26"" to 27"" with 1 side crashed. Too bad, i cant share the photo here or else you wont have to imagine how it looks like. Anyway, that was lucky that everything is working because there is another hard product box that protecting all the items.

Lastly, do read clearly about the insurance cover that provide in Buy&Ship. If item damaged, only 30% of shipping fee can be claimed. Another words, the insurance only covering loss parcel and damaged items are not consider claimable but partial refund shipping fee. So, the insurance is pretty much useless because 80% are shipment damaged problem while loss item maybe 20% or lower.",,1,0,0,MY,BuyandShip,2025-08-18T08:44:28.000Z,1767144181203

When purchasing from multiple stores, those other services (Starts with a Vxxx) failed to notify me if all packages had arrived for consolidation. They didn’t provide updates on parcel status unless I paid extra for upgrades, which made the process confusing and costly. Ultimately, due to this lack of transparency, I ended up paying five times more compared to when I switched to Buy&Ship!

Buy&Ship completely changed my experience. Their instructions are clear and straightforward, there was no need to second guess the information. What you see is exactly what you get! They provide an itemized list of items that have arrived at their location, so you can easily track if all your purchases are ready for consolidation and shipping. Another great feature is their notification system, which informs you how many days of free storage you have left before incurring charges... they typically offer 30 days for free storage.

A parcel I ordered from Japan arrived with severe leakage due to mishandling and repacking. Their team insisted it was the seller’s fault, but I’ve used Japanese sellers for years and never once had an issue like this — their packaging is always extremely secure. The real problem lies in Buyandship’s repackaging process, where they remove the outer protective boxes to save space. This negligence directly caused the bottles to be exposed and leak during transport.

Worse still, their customer service (especially “Rain”) was unhelpful, dismissive, and evasive. They refused to take responsibility, avoided answering my direct questions, and deleted parts of our conversation. I asked for a supervisor — they ignored me. I requested a video to show how my goods were damaged — ignored again.

I’ve used many international forwarding services over the years — this is by far the worst. They mishandled my goods, then tried to wash their hands of any responsibility. I will never use Buyandship again and would not recommend it to anyone who cares about their items arriving safely.",,1,0,1,TW,BuyandShip,2025-06-19T09:39:01.000Z,1767144196597

So far we have no unpleasant surprised by Buy and Ship in Hong Kong warehouse to Malaysia. UPS delivery 🚚 Team were superb and friendly services .
Tracking Apps both are working in a great shape.

The only suggestions are larger items above 110 cm on 3 sides hope your esteemed company can accept it in a very near future . As we are using DHL Express in the Europe and UK.

A seafrieght & airfreight alternatives services should be implemented for bulk items. We don't mind if it's a 3rd party outsource company from UPS or FedEx.

We sincerely hope that you are able to maintain the current rates as we have been given a heads up by our Strategic partnership in the EU countries . Shipping rates are expected for a hike of 20% ~30% this year.

3 years ago(2022) I bought an item from US to ship to Singapore using this service as that product was not in Singapore at that time. I recall it sitting in the warehouse for a while before shipping to SG. 

I read reviews saying they may swap your item with a knockoff if it is a high value item. My item was less than 20 USD so I thought it would be fine.

When we received it in SG we noticed that the item seemed off but there was not enough images online of the actual product to be sure.

I only realised recently that I had gotten scammed when I saw the ACTUAL genuine item in stores in SG. (As the item seemed to now be sold here as well).

Googling more after seeing it in stores, I saw online images of the exact knockoff product that they replaced my item with and likely sold the original off to make a profit.

Seeing other REAL reviews from people it seems that even if I caught it upon receiving my product, their customer service lines and service itself is completely useless! 

I would NOT recommend this company and stray FAR away from it. ",,1,0,1,SG,BuyandShip,2025-05-19T23:03:34.000Z,1767144201934

ECU was not even a prohibited item and they deemed it prohibited AFTER I paid for the item. After talking to support, they confirmed that it was not prohibited and immediately told me to reorder it even tho I have not received my refund yet. Made the payment last 04-28-2025 and until now I have not yet received my refund.

Update:
The bank has confirmed that there wasn't any refund.
